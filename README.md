# CASCADING STYLES
    Here you can note the following

1. **LAST RULE**: 
            If the two selectors are identical, 
            the latter of the two will take 
            precedence. Here you can see 
            the second i selector takes 
            precedence over the first

2. **SPECIFICITY**:
            If one selecor is more specific than the other, the more specific rule will take preference over the less specific.

3. **IMPORTANT**:
            You can add `!important` to your style to ensure that **CSS** ignores other rules and uses that style.

Take time to peruse this simple code and I hope this helps you get better with CSS.
